Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps and AWS Account Setup

The first day of our DevOps Skill Lab training began with an insightful session introducing us to the fundamentals of DevOps. The session was conducted through a presentation that explained the core principles, practices, and lifecycle of DevOps. We were also guided through the process of creating our individual AWS (Amazon Web Services) accounts, which will be used for hands-on lab exercises in the upcoming sessions.The concepts were explained through a presentation using slides and visual aids, which helped in understanding the theory in a more structured and effective manner.


DevOps - Development and Operations:
DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that brings together software development and IT operations to enable faster and more reliable software delivery. It focuses on enhancing collaboration between teams, automating workflows, and establishing a continuous feedback loop to improve the quality of software systems.


Key Principles of DevOps:

1. Collaboration: Promoting better communication between development and operations teams.

2. Automation: Minimizing manual tasks by automating testing, deployment, and infrastructure setup.

3. Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Ensuring that code changes are tested and delivered frequently and reliably.

4. Monitoring and Feedback: Continuously observing system performance and acting on feedback to enhance efficiency.
   

DevOps Lifecycle:

The DevOps lifecycle includes several interconnected stages that support continuous development and deployment. These stages are:

1. Plan: Defining project goals and requirements.

2. Develop: Writing and managing source code.

3. Build: Compiling code and generating artifacts.

4. Test: Performing automated and manual testing.

5. Release: Preparing the application for deployment.

6. Deploy: Deploying applications to the production environment.

7. Operate: Managing infrastructure and maintaining system health.

8. Monitor: Tracking performance and collecting user feedback.


Setting up of AWS Account:

As part of the day’s practical task, we were guided through the process of setting up our individual AWS accounts. AWS is a widely used cloud service provider that offers scalable computing resources and is an integral part of many DevOps workflows.

Steps Followed for AWS Setup:
Step 1: Visited the official AWS website and initiated the account creation process.

Step 2: Provided necessary details such as:

-> Email address

-> Account name

-> Root user password

  Entered personal or business contact information.

Step 3: Added a valid credit/debit card for billing purposes (AWS offers a free usage tier).

Step 4: Completed identity verification via OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

Step 5: Selected the Basic (Free) support plan.

Step 6: Logged in to the AWS Management Console using the registered credentials.


Outcomes:
By the end of the session, we gained a clear understanding of the DevOps philosophy and lifecycle, and we successfully created and accessed our AWS accounts in preparation for practical tasks in the upcoming days.
